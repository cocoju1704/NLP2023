@TwelveTribesForever,"Concerning the Harvard University president which is being targeted because the zionists don't like her.

She is suddenly being accused of plagiarism. This is a good thing. 

I urge CNN to call for a comprehensive review of all plagiarism and clean house. The same topic came up concerning Ursula von der Leyen (the President of the European Commission)."

And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.”*
Gospel of Luke, chapter 21, verse 25 to 28.

*“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.”*
Gospel of John, chapter 3, verse 16 to 18.

@danielomane6729,"SATAN(ALSO KNOWN AS LUCIFER OR THE DEVIL) IS EXPOSED!!!!! Hell was created for Satan and his fallen Angels(Matthew 25:41 AND 2Peter 2:4).Satan and his fallen Angels fought God’s angels to overthrow God but were defeated and were thus thrown out of heaven to the earth(Isaiah14:12-14 AND Revelation 12:7-10).Satan and his fallen Angels will be thrown into hell to be tormented 24/7 for ever and ever(Revelation 20:10 AND Jude 1:7).Satan and his fallen Angels want you to join them suffer in hell even though you were not part of the coup makers(Revelations 20:10-15).Satan, and for that matter his fallen Angels stand condemned by God and hence do not have any chance of repentance(John 16:11).Fortunately, you and I have up to minutes before our death to repent just like the criminal on the right side of Jesus on the cross (Luke 23:39-43) WHY NOT REPENT NOW AND GIVE YOUR LIFE TO JESUS? Since you don’t know how and when you will die, my brother or sister, THE TIME TO REPENT IS NOW AND GIVE YOUR LIFE TO JESUS!!!"

@user-de4hj4fc5j,"Dear Mr. Xi Jin Ping - President of China :      ( Bản dich cuối trang )
I am Bui Hieu Vo, a political prisoner under surveillance of Police  in District 7, Saigon - Vietnam. 
Just because I wrote a letter to prevent the construction of  oil refinery to Tran Duc Luong, Nguyen Tan Dung, Dinh La Thang... on the grounds that Vietnamese crude oil has a high pour point  (33 degrees Celsius), so if the oil is refined in Vietnam that is sure to suffer very heavy losses. So they stole all my land, created false evidence, sent me to prison, and tried every way to hunt me down.
 In prison, I invented 15 applied scientific inventions that could change the world 
1, Hydroelectric dams that do not release floods never break, even in earthquakes, unless the earth cracks at the dam body 
2, Breakwaters Dam to prevent coastal erosion
 3, Expand the island, build an airport and port on the island at a cost 10% and time 3 times faster than the method that China is doing today 
4, Stove  Burning waste completely without smoke, without odor, without using a exhaust  fan
and ....etc 

 Even when I was in prison and released from prison, I continued to send letters to Vietnam's Leaders  but the police stopped and terrorized me, and on November 30, 2022, they bombed me .
 I beg you to help me seek justice and save me from Vietnam as soon as possible. I will dedicate these scientific invention  to China. Because I'm afraid that if they kill me, these scientific discoveries will forever lie dormant and the disaster for the world will be very serious. 
I hope you will send a scientific council to meet me. I pledge that no one can refute


Kính gửi ông : Tập Cận Bình :
Tôi là Bùi Hiếu Võ tù chính trị đang bị quản chế tại Q7,Sài Gòn - VN . Chỉ vì tôi đã viết thư ngăn cản xây nhà máy Lọc dầu cho Trần Đức Lương , Nguyễn Tấn Dũng , Đinh La  Thăng ...với lý do là dầu thô VN có nhiệt độ đông đặc cao ( 33 độ C ) nên   nếu lọc dầu VN là cầm chắc lỗ rất nặng . Thế là chúng nó cướp hết đất của tôi và tạo  bằng chứng giả bắt tôi đi tù rồi   tìm đủ mọi cách truy sát  tôi .
Trong tù tôi đã phát minh ra 15 phát minh khoa học ứng dụng có thể thay đổi cả thế giới 
1, Đập thủy điện không xả lũ  không bao giờ bị vỡ kể cả động đất ,trừ khi trái đất nứt ra tại thân đập 
2, Đê chắn sóng chống sạt lở bờ biển
3, Mở rộng  đảo , làm cả sân bay và bến cảng trên đảo với giá tiền bằng 10/% và thời gian nhanh gấp 3 lần so với phương pháp mà TQ đang làm hiên nay 
4, Lò đốt rác thải  cháy toàn phần  không khói , không mùi , không  cần dùng quạt khò
5, Kè chống sạt lở bờ sông kết hợp đường giao thông và cầu cảng cho vận tải thủy nội địa 
Và rất nhiều phát minh khác có thể ứng dụng rất hiệu quả 
Ngay khi còn ở trong tù  và ra tù tôi vẫn tiếp tục gửi thư cho bộ CT của VN nhưng đã bị bọn CA ngăn chặn , khủng bố và ngày  30/11/2022 chúng nó đánh bom thư để  sát hại tôi 
Vì vậy tôi cầu xin ông hãy giúp tôi đòi công lý và cứu  tôi thoát  khỏi VN càng sớm càng tốt .Tôi sẽ cống hiến các phát minh khoa học này cho TQ .  Bởi vì tôi sợ chúng nó giết tôi thì những phát minh khoa học này sẽ vĩnh viễn ngủ yên và thảm họa đối với thế giới sẽ  rất nghiêm trọng 
Tôi mong ông hãy cử 1 hội đồng khoa học gặp tôi . Tôi cam kết không ai có thể phản biện được

Tôi đang bị bọn Mafia đỏ đạo đức HCM truy sát nên tôi sẵn sàng cống hiến tất cả các phát minh khoa học cho TQ nếu ông giúp tôi đòi công lý và  thoát khỏi VN 
 
       Thanh Nhàn sánh bước  Quỳnh Vân 
    Kim Ngân đi  với đàn em Thanh Trà

Vì vậy tất cả tội ác mà 3X gây ra cho nhân dân VN đều có sự  tham gia chỉ đạo của Triết và Nguyễn Sinh Hùng, Trần Đức Lương  . Chỉ mấy ngày bú liếm bên xứ sở hoa hậu Venezuela mà Triết đã chỉ đạo 3X chuyển  hơn 1,1 tỷ đô Mỹ bất chấp Nguyễn Phú Trọng không đồng ý

As for the under 30 of all races demographic the pendulum has swung massively towards Trump. So single white women under 50 are very much Biden. Alas, now here is my question . Why is this demographic always the last always at everything ? Everybody else has vastly woken up, except the Madame of the Plantation !! Just watch how they love themselves on television. The uglier they are, the more prone they are to vote liberal."

@KINGSOFGOD-ob2dt,Biden helped the country by bringing millions of immigrants here because he was looking out like a soldier and he's not even embarrassed so he's the real hero. That's how president soldier secures the country by surrounding us with immigrants but he said it has to be done during pandemics because thats how you creat panic getting many here. The vice president is needs to have some embarrassment and strongly address her black people for the the thousands of crimes they are committing and it has to be her because she's the highest black person in the presidency but she says nothing. No disrespect but I'd be to black right now so i know she's embarrassed of being black. I love black people i truly do by I just don't want to see them in cages or not allowed to in store anymore. Let's hope and pray gods king and prophet can not make what i see coming ever happen but I am trying and I've been for a few years but nobody helps me 💧 Leo gave me the stupidest excuse one time why important black people can't speak up against black people committing crimes and used the constitution to worm around it. Every black person is going to want to speak up when their not allowed in stores anymore but why now ill say ?

@ceyhunquliyev7865,"Russian Armed Forces are the biggest threat to the security of Europe, NATO and the World. If Ukraine is invaded, there will never be peace in Europe. In European countries, the situation will be the same as in Syria, Algeria, Yemen, Somalia, Bangladesh, Morocco, North Sudan, Kazakhstan, Niger, Iraq, Senegal and Turkmenistan. Citizens of these countries serve in the Russian Army. Ilham Aliyev, Nicolas Maduro and Serdar Berdimuhamedow supplies diesel and oil to the Russian army. Kaliningrad, Saint Petersburg, Minsk and Moscow is under the jurisdiction of the European Union and NATO. Killer Vladimir Putin is looking for an excuse to use nuclear weapons. If the Russian army is defeated, an atomic bomb will be dropped on Oslo, Paris, London, Rome, Lisbon, Kyiv, New York, Brussels, Toronto and Warsaw. If Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Kaliningrad, Crimea, Donbas are attacked, the Russian army will launch Topol-M with a nuclear warhead. Kim Jong Un, Alexander Lukashenko, Xi Jinping, Ebrahim Raisi sends weapons and ammunition to Russia. Vladimir Putin wants to stop grain exports and make Europe economically dependent on him by attacking Donetsk, Odessa, Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv and Kherson ports with high-precision hypersonic missiles and kamikaze drones. “All ships arriving at Ukrainian ports will be considered as military cargo ships and will be destroyed. For this, we started a military exercises in the Black Sea”, Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation said. By order of Vladimir Putin, nuclear and chemical weapons were placed in Belarus. If Belarus is attacked, there will be a huge Hiroshima and Nagasaki tragedy in Europe"

@leyla.lala.,"In the war that started on October 7, 2023, thousands of peaceful Palestinians were killed as a result of the genocide and ethnic cleansing committed by the occupying Israeli Army. All Israeli citizens have the blood of innocent people on their hands. Hundreds of innocent Palestinians were arrested and tortured. The Israeli Prime Minister later admitted that the number of dead Israelis was small. Israeli Army should defend Europe in Ukraine instead of committing genocide. Israeli made weapons and ammunition should be sell to Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia. Because it is sell to Azerbaijan. Unfortunately, Israel does not contribute anything to the security of Europe. Israel is not a friend of Europe and The USA"
