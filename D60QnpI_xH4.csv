@lindas1574,I worked night shift Sept 10 in ICU. It was one of 'those' nights and I was exhausted when I got home the morining of Sept 11. So i went straight to bed. I was going to have to go back for another shift at 7:PM. My husband woke me at 3 and told me this fantastic tale about airplanes flying into the Twin Towers. Ha ha. Funny man. But he was not joking. I will never forget the cold that washed over me as I saw the news reports and the replays of the events that morning.
@ninjapurpura1,Again
@El-vi6lg,"Still haunts me to this day. I always remember. In my homeland, Poland, the whole country went into a state of shock, disbelief and utter devastated tears- for us, this event reminded us of the Nazi attack on our nation in 1939. The whole country was in grief. It was an attack on the whole civilized world and an atack on us all who love and will fight for FREEDOM. OUR HEARTS BROKE THAT DAY. WE love America and we love freedom.God Bless all the victims and their loved ones."
@user-tp2yj5id2k,I wish I could fix that. I fix shit like this for a living. Mafioso. Italian. But we can not fix this... Our concern is still with those families that lost their loved ones due to this tragedy. I am retired from activity with my underworld. I'm old but feel how it is to suffer emphatically.

@lordoreocat,"This is horrifying. This is what humans do to each other. We kill each other. We torture each other. We starve each other. I don't see other animals doing this. What people do to other people disgusts me. Why do we do it? For revenge? For land? For victory? Because others have a different set of beliefs? For even the dumbest and stupidest reasons we do these things. May all those souls rest in peace. I am an atheist, but I hope they are doing okay if there is a heaven or another world. Though it is over, people still mourn the humans that died in that building. They mourn their loved ones or even people they do not know.."

@kennerfee100,"i was 3 when this happened. somehow, i remember being in pre-school watching tv and seeing the two towers burning. my teacher was scared and the other kids were scared, except this one kid was laughing becuz he saw a plane and the buildings go down. i was traumatized and we were just trying to watch whatever kids were watching on the tv, i dont remember."

@TessaiyaSongBird,"So my father used to work in the hotel that was right under the World Trade Center. He was late to work that day and dropped me off at kindergarten in jersey city when I was 4. Thank..god..he went late. He was suppose to be there at 8:30am but woke up around that time and left at 8:40 it was a 30 minute drive,he was on his way when he heard the first plane hit but he didn't belive it. But there's a park on his way to work where it had a clear shot of the World Trade Center he stopped and he told me he literally saw the second plane go into the world trade, he stayed there and even watched as both towers went down. He was good friends with the man known as the falling man, and it hurt him to see him in the photos so he doesn't like to talk about it. But he came to pick me up right afterwards and told me what happened. Idk why but even at four I had an idea of how insane it was what was happening, and now every year during September I watch these old videos and more and more I realize how tragic and devastating it was and I'm so thankful my father was late I could have lost him that day. Every time I go to the world trade my heart just races and there's a always a overwhelming sorrow that even 21 years later you can feel."

@dbdb32,"I was in the 6th grade. We were in school and all courses ended and everyone was sent to homeroom until end of day. We went into class with the TV already on. Students were being picked up early one by one. My town ran a second edition of the newspaper that day covering the story. Over the course of the next week would be the last time I saw .99 cent gas prices in my life up until this point. The preeminent thought on my mind at the time was if my dad would get drafted. He told me it was unlikely but if so he would serve again since it would be his duty. Looking at the world today, I feel like events leading up to this, sept 11, and how tragedy is portrayed in the media was the turning point into ""the new normal"" for our generation. Before leaving homeroom, my teacher stood in front of all of us and said ""The world as we knew it before today no longer exists...regardless of your beliefs.""....she wasn't wrong. The best way I could describe how I felt was lack of security. We always thought ""oh, things like that don't happen here"" and it showed my ignorance as an ordinary American. Even now I look back and remember a feeling of idk despair, confusion, anxiety, fear, uncertainty it was a lot that day, and I feel for the fallen, their families, and the brave humans that survived in nyc that day."

@or10nsharkfin,"I was overseas at the time. My dad was in the US Army, stationed in Schweinfurt, Germany. I remember the day being as normal as it could be for us. Since we were about six hours ahead of the US East Coast these events started happening around when school was letting out for us. We were unaware of what was going on until I got home and our next-door neighbor met us in the hallway of our apartment and told us to turn on the news. We watched the TV, fixated on what was going on. My brother was able to make it home that night, as he was going to school up in Wurzburg and left just before they closed the gates to the base up there and locked down the post. School was closed the next two days for us. All we could do was just watch the news reports. I was young, but understanding enough to know what was happening. I knew things were going to change."

@DrKeez,"Just graduated high school and got my first job, sleeping in on my day off. Mother calls me tells me to flip on the TV, watched the second one hit live several minutes later. Then the Pentagon and reports of another plane crash in Pennsylvania. The hits kept coming, I knew then our lives and culture would be altered forever.

This is a very dark time for our country...Trump was not supposed to ever be President, but once he showed what a leader he is, they (the woke democrats), needed to make sure he wasn't put in office again...and if now for the manipulation by the Chinese in our voting machines, he would be in the WH today...because we ALL know that it was HE who won the election in a landslide...not Biden...and it's all because of China...Covid came from there...the voting machine guts were made in China...the masks (which could be sprayed with microscopic virus's), came from China...and even though some of us buy them on-line, without even checking out how they're made, we slap them over our faces without washing them first...then we have vaccines that have nothing to do with Covid...but are deadly in their own right - check out Dr. Sherry Tenpenny's 'depopulation"" video...(she's put her entire career on the line to warn us)...but very few people gave much thought to letting the government jab a chemical into our arms...and now it's maybe going to be mandatory!!! God has a Plan and this is all part of it...I truly expect to be caught up in the air any day...I am so ecstatic to know that I'm on the right side of the entire thing!!

I am a fair person to offer to always love anyone in the entire world who will forever reciprocate that kindness. No one in the world though except my family and friends reciprocates. The result is that everyone else in the world is evil since only evil people would not reciprocate any kindness offered to them. This includes the victims in this case. So, only an evil person died in this case. Thus, it would be irrational for me to be sad with the loss of evil people since the degree of the loss of evil people equals the degree to which the world becomes a better place."

But a few hours later, when he was facetiming my ibf's mom, he saw the news and wasn't so pissed off anymore xD. But really sad that happened, so many people died. Mom's, Dad's , Uncle's, Aunt's, Friends, so MANY people. And the worst part was that the elevators were blocked off. Its just so sad that now look at the world even 19 years after the event. We've got bully's and online bully's, COVID-19, our goverment is a dumbass, and we have people being RACIST AGAIN. God, we are all americans.

@SnowAnayathatweirdgirl,"I was 13 when this happened. I remember that day so vividly it's like it was yesterday. I was getting ready for school and watching the Today Show (I liked watching it before school.) I saw the live feed to the first tower and I thought "" Holy shit! "" I thought surely it was an accident and that's when I saw the second plane hit the second tower and I just stood there my mind was going ""What the fuck is going on!!??"" I went to school the t.v's where on in every class some where rolled into class. We found out America was attacked and we all just looked at each other like ""How?? I thought we were safe? HOW?"". I remember kids being pulled out of school. One girl was screaming at the vice principle that her dad was in NYC near the WTC second tower she was screaming at him to help her and he couldn't all he could do was be there with her while she tried to call her dad (Luckily he escaped in time.) I saw people jumping out of those buildings. Seeing people have to pick which way to die is another kind of fucked. Some people were crying I was silent I couldn't talk I just felt like things were gonna get worse were not safe everything has changed. I still can't fully watch clips about it cause I just feel the pain and terror all these innocent people felt. I will always remember the pain of my fellow Americans who died and lost loved ones. The first responders who risked their lives to save people and the brave souls of United 93 who knew they were gonna die, but made sure those fucks didn't get to their destination true act of bravery that I'll never forget. My daughter asked me about 9-11 and I still don't know how to explain it to her today and all I could say was ""It hurts, it's a different pain a sadness.. I hope you never have to witness that kind of tragedy again."" Her generation is dealing with school shootings and now a pandemic so she feels some of those feelings. But, it's nothing like witnessing people die and being so helpless to help them that you cry. I think we all deal with it differently I keep it to myself, but right now I'm just telling strangers how I feel.. cause shit it's crazy times so why not share my emotions and thoughts of this day."

@kevandre,"Usually on the anniversary of 9/11 I notice it, make a remark or something and just kind of go on with my day, but... it's kind of hitting different in 2020. I don't know if it's because we're in the midst of a pandemic that has claimed more lives than 9/11 did, or if it's because my state is on fire worse than ever before, or what. But it almost feels like I'm experiencing the actual DAY again, the way my somber mood and heartbeat have been going, watching these videos. Almost twenty fucking years already. Jesus."

@firacingast,"19 years on and I still won't ever forget this day. It was one of my first memories in life, and it's a day I cannot and will not ever forget. Rest in peace to everyone who lost their lives that day and those that have died from medical complications sustained in the fight to save others lives that day. Having been to the monument in NY, it's extremely humbling and the emotions of this day still weigh on American shoulders there every single day. Our emergency services in this country get a lot of flak at times, but they're heroes and we need to remember that. They risk their lives day in and day out, and sometimes they pay with them so that we can have a safe society. Thank you to all the police, fire, emergency, and military service members! You are appreciated."

@steeldriver8577,"I remember nothing like this had ever happened before. I was in the 6th grade. Every TV was on and all teachers and students fell silent. Many had gathered in the music classroom which was very large. At first I didn't know what was going on. By the second crash, I watched some of the teachers sink to the floor in tears. By the time cameras were showing people jumping to their deaths, I'd been provoked to a state of anger, I couldn't even comprehend my own emotions. On my 18th birthday, I joined the military."

@PresbyterianSoldier,"Whats so hard for me to watch now. Is just how far we as Americans have changed. In 2001 CNN was respected, trusted, and even admired as the first place to find truth and get caught up on what was going on in the world. Today CNN is actually a weapon. They are solely in existence to manipulate the people, corroborate, and push the Democratic agenda. I am truly deeply saddened by this. What happened to you @CNN you used to be so admirable. I know my little comment will fall on deaf ears, and as social media usually produces, a lot of hate messages, threats, and even defamation. I don't care. My God, My God why have you forsaken me? And given me this no longer identifiable version of what once was a reliable, respected, and meaningful information source........Now I stand ready for the Hundreds of Hateful emails from Democrats attacking me, putting down my faith, and threatening me and my my family.

NTSB would have told the world that no plane crashed in Pa. that's why it came from the top. NTSB is world renown for American high jacked and crashed planes and they would not play along with the bush admin and Israel and the rest of those neo Zionist Talmudic khazar fake jews."
@TeeDee87,"For start to point it, I'm not American, I live in Europe. But the day this happened I was 14 years old. I've got my first broadband internet couple days before which I couldn't get working. When I finally figured it out and got it working I was excited as teenager can be. Checked that is my connection working went to yahoo.com. First thing I see is this (first plane has just hit the first tower). Whole day I was reading and watching tv trying to understand that what had happened and when it was clear that this is terrorist attack I can't describe the shock inside me. How in hell can someone be so bad to others that does this? Everyday there happens very bad things all around the globe that are so mean and disgusting but this event was by far in my books the most disgusting terrorist attack in my lifetime."

To the point where I literally had intrusive thoughts for 8 months because I was so insecure about my childhood taking place in the same decade as these terrorist attacks.

@sonnyzehm105,I'm not buying the fact that those two towers collapse under their own weight we all saw those Towers leaning when the planes hit them now I'm going to tell you the laws of physics here if that was Towers had collapsed under their own weight the way they were leaning when they were hit they would have collapsed in that direction they would not have fallen straight in on themselves once again people we all saw those Towers leaning when they were hit stand up stand tall as if you were a Tower lean to one side now fall over did you fall in on yourself or did you actually fall over now I think about those Towers as they were hit we all saw them leaning the laws of physics would tell you that if they were going to fall they would fall towards That Lean they would not have fallen in on themselves once again folks they were designed to take the hit of a 747 and survive once again a 767 isn't that much bigger than a 747 it is on scale but when it comes to that Size of a building it really isn't the laws of physics would tell you then if you are leaning you're going to fall in the direction in which you are leaning towards now I wasn't there but from what I was told the third building that fell was two or three blocks from the towers once again if that building was right underneath the towers I could understand the weight of the tower causing that building to collapse but if the building was two or three blocks away from the towers and those Towers did not fall in the direction we thought they would fall if they were going to then that building should not have fallen at all let me ask you this again how do you explain the molten steel that was in the basement those fires were not that hot to where they could have melted the steel yes they were hot yes they may have been hot enough to cause the steel to Warp but they were not hot enough to melt the steel listen up people I'm going to say this again steel melts at about 3000 degrees that fire was 1000 degrees how was there molten Steel in the basement now I'm going to say this the guy that's messing around with a piece of Steel causing it to bend that is a piece of Steel it is not a steel beam yeah I have no doubt that you can get a piece of Steel so red hot that you can actually bend it but again that's not a steel beam so tell me another one before it gets cold I'm not buying it you're not selling it once again people we are talking steel and concrete cement now think about it think about it closely and carefully if you have steel crashing into concrete and then crashing into steel and then crashing into concrete and then crashing into Steel is it going to sound like a bomb or is it going to sound like a car accident think about this there are eyewitnesses that heard explosions moments before the towers collapsed those Towers were bombed it wasn't just the planes that brought them down just as that third tower that fell once again that third Tower from what I was told was two or three blocks away from the first two towers it had nothing to do with the World Trade Center I'm going to say this again if that last hour was right under the World Trade Center as the World Trade Center fell I could understand. Tower collapsing but if it was two or three blocks away it should have had nothing to do with it

Patriotism and rememberence is fine but what we did and what we became doesn't honor them. How many innocents people died in our wars over there? Its in the tens of thousands. Our success was in killing leadership and busting networks, not destructive wars and ""restructuring""."

@adv.monisha5074,"The whole video is so painful to watch. I remember when this happened, i was about 10 years old and my parents were watching this on tv. They were all shocked and shattered but as a child, i didn't understand what was happening.. i was wondering that the planes are supposed to fly in the sky but why were they flying inside the building. I just couldn't figure it out. I didn't know at the time what terrorism was and ppl can be that much evil ! Now I am 27 years old and I realise what happened that day and i just cant stop holding my tears. Why on earth ppl have to take lives of the innocents ? Why they have to be evil? Why do they do that? Do they not fear our Almighty God ? I will never understand that. Even today my heart gets broken into pieces when i watch this video. This is the pain i cant even describe. I will only say one thing, may the victims rest in peace in Heaven and I am and will always be with their families. Hug and Love from India. We are with you."
@meredithsosik7724,"2997 are dead, what had this world come to? People jumped out windows so they went burn to death. Worst of all, there are still terrorists from 9/11 on the loose. Buildings collapsed with people still on high floors and now they are just, dead,gone, and never forgotten."

As for the fairly tale about the Pentagon being attacks by an aircraft? Grow up and face the real truth. The official version of 9/11 is the greatest lie of the 21st century!"

First everybody was in panic and soon after you can smell smoke because the hudson river and the world trade wasn't to far from where we were. Its was terrifying. My dad was one of the first parents to come and get me and my sister. while we drove home all we saw in the back window was big thick clouds of smoke.

@dragonx3499,"The saddest thing about this event is that it was the last time I can remember when we as a nation stopped caring about hyphenated identities and just stood together as Americans. We stood as a nation in morning, we stood as a nation that was healing and then stood as a nation to seek justice. All of that has been lost and we are now neck-deep in our own political agendas that have become so toxic to the soul of this nation that I don't know if we will ever recover. We need to remember that no matter what our ethnic background is we are all Americans. We all have the same red blood flowing through all of us and we can only survive if we stand together. The images we saw in this video and others were of everyday people helping total strangers that is what America is not white vs black or Republican vs Democrat we are America and we should be proud of that."

@youristevens379,"Genuinely, the darkest day in our history. I was but 4 when this happened. And for many many years, right up untill 2018, i've always been too afraid to even watch any footage of this tragedy. I remember in 5 years ago exactly in high school, we had to watch a documentary on this, and i just couldn't. This is the kind of stuff you would only ever expect in movies, NEVER in real life. and the unimaginable amount of lives lost here, and even more lives affected by this, are just too much to handle. Putting myself in the shoes of the people who saw this happening with their own eyes, i can't even begin to imagine the fear they felt. And even now, watching it, with no person connection to the event at all, it's truly difficult not to cry watching this, and realizing that this is reality, and not some made up action scene. Absolutely terrifying, and all this for an imaginary deity. All those lives for something that does not exist."

@cryptocurrencyhead2668,"How did they think and plan everything, filmed dozens of videos from different angles and started editing with airplanes on air (at that time the computers of the snenarists were what they needed, which allowed them to create the installation and graphics in a matter of minutes, when it took an ordinary man in the street whole days, and even more so when preparation was carried out before September 11, possibly several years long) I recall the TV broadcast then was broadcast in very low resolution, a maximum of 480p (like fake source videos of the same quality) everyone ate and accepted does this fake."
@pound4poundbeast,This was the longest saddest day.
@smutshawty,"This really makes me sick.. It scares me also. Even though I haven't been born during that time it just makes me feel a different way about the world now. How can people be so evil, why would anyone do a suicide mission? I want to meet those terrorists in person and just ask them why? Even if they are dead. :( Just so disappointing.."

@barrypike01,And after going to war mk2 we the world then let's Arabs into our countries. In my opinion this was the worse thing anyone could do. I've met lots of lovely Muslims. However I've met some that spill out hate towards the West. I've got into arguments when I heard how they were going to take over our country one day. As the argument was in the high street the police who were there watching and with arms crossed threatened me with arrest. All I said was you clearly don't like us so go home. I never swore. I said they're preaching hate on our streets and you do nothing but stand there?. 1 policeman goes the powers that be have instructed us to leave them alone and not arrest them. 7 of them to be precise. So they get a little closer to ruling us by giving them power and protection. To me it's all wrong
@vze21gwa,It's been 18 years and the pain is still real. I was 12 when it happened. I still remember everything vividly. I remember the worst of it was September 12th when you realized it wasn't a dream. The day later on September 13th we went back to school and everyone seemed like a zombie. RIP to the victims of 9/11.

This is HATE at it's core. I don't know the inner workings of government or the military...there are just some things that maybe I shouldn't know...but this. This is simply...heartbreaking. The individuals whose lives were taken on this day are living in The Light...I continue to pray for their families for comfort and healing. I also pray for our country...our country needs to bring itself back to the way we were on 9/12/01...if we don't...we are lost. God Bless!"

@tomnewsted5004,"The saddest thing about this event is that it was the last time I can remember when we as a nation stopped caring about hyphenated identities and just stood together as Americans. We stood as a nation in morning, we stood as a nation that was healing and then stood as a nation to seek justice. All of that has been lost and we are now neck deep in our own political agendas that have become so toxic to the soul of this nation that I don't know if we will ever recover. We need to remember that no matter what our ethnic background is we are all Americans. We all have the same red blood flowing through all of us and we can only survive if we stand together. The images we saw in this video and others were of everyday people helping total strangers that is what America is not white vs black or Republican vs Democrat we are America and we should be proud of that."

@deborahfowier5107,Why Why? I will never in my life understand why people can take lives in such a senseless way or how they can take so many lives on purpose. I grasp at trying to understand and it leads my mind to how much hatred these foreign people had against Americans. I will never truly understand maybe one day I'll find the answer from God. Til then I will always pray for PEACE. For without hope there is no way for PEACE and we all at the end of the day want love and peace! Don't we?

@avehurley4722,"This was real coverage. I used to always watch CNN and watched from my hospital bed the day this happened.Why has CNN changed so much over the years that it is no longer as reliable as it once was? We shall never forget 911 but the younger generation today is not being told the truth and some know so little about what happened that day. We need to return to truth patriotism and pull our nation together again not keep tearing it apart as is happening now,. And with this coverage why does CNN now push so much fake news today? Why isn't CNN leading in providing unbiased real coverage warning Americans that we are still under attack in our nation in many subtle and not so subtle ways through illegal immigration and corrupted politics that instead of helping to unify our nation they push to further tear us all apart? We need to make and keep America great again."

@branchwilliams8898,"Sadly, there is one other crash that this and many other videos often overlook. The crash of United Airlines flight 93. The passengers of 93 were the only people that made an attempt to resist the hijackers of 9/11/01. The 40 of them talked secretly amongst each other for about an hour as the plane flew to its next target. One of them just so happened to be a pilot. They had been held hostage using a fake explosive device. They soon discovered this, and overpowered the two keeping them from the aircraft cabin. They broke down the locked door and fought the remaining two hijackers for control of the aircraft in an attempt to land it away from its target. But they were minutes too late. In the fight for control of the cockpit the plane began its plunging descent towards the empty farming fields of Pennsylvania, and the crew and passengers were all dead on impact. The crash site spanned for 5 miles and 80% of the remains were vaporized on impact. The only means of Identification was the flight roster."

@Cartagena1,"I was in New York City two weeks before the events of 9/11. My family had been on vacation the summer I turned 15, what ended up being the best summer of my childhood, and we ended it with a visit to Manhattan. I wanted so badly to go up into one of the Twin Towers. I'd wanted to visit those buildings my whole life at that point. But we ran out of time, and my dad promised that the next time we went to New York, it would be the first thing we did. 2 weeks later, it's the second week of my sophomore year of high school and I'm sitting in horror watching these events unfold in real time in third period journalism class, then in fourth period health class. By lunch, half the students had gone home. My parents worked for the government at the time, so there was no leaving early for me. They called the school to make sure a message could get to my sister and I that they were both OK. I got home that afternoon and we all just continued to watch the news, learning more and more. Somehow I knew when I went to bed that night that my childhood was officially over, and the world was going to change. Today at the age of 33, there are a lot of things I miss about being younger, but nothing more than what life used to be like in the pre-9/11 world."

@ipinkbat,"I wasn't even born in 2001,but my mom was in the united states during the attack and we couldn't almost get home (she was pregnant with me) and I'm so heartbroken because of every single story of them. Love to all of these families 17 years later. Never forget :("
@Brandon-rq3ys,"Mid-August, 2001, me, my father and my brother are driving from Florida back home to Boston. I was 17 and had just gotten a new cheap little camcorder. As we travelled through NYC, I filmed all that I could. Surprisingly, even though i was from Boston, just a few hours away, I had never been to NYC. And my father wouldn't stop, either. So i filmed all that I could. But my favorite was the World Trade Center, for sure. Being so close to it, seeing how enormous it really was had amzed me! I think that was the only time in my life that I was happy we were stuck in a traffic Jam. So, after about 30 minutes of filming the camera started beeping. Yes, it let out a loud ""beeeep...beeeep...beeeeep!"" when it was low battery. My father was annoyed by the noise and says to me: ""Put the camera away, I'll bring you to the WTC next summer. They're not going anywhere!"" And i actually have him on video saying this. I plan on uploading it on here someday soon when i can figure out how to put my VHS footage onto a computer or phone. Every person I've ever showed that video to is almost freaked out by what he says. Because he lets out a creepy little laugh afterwards, like he knows. Obviously that wasn't the case. But the situation and just the coincidence that 3 weeks later they collapsed. It's terrifying to me."

@lenglain,"Was in high school in midtown when it happened. It was hard to undertstand the gravity of the situation, we were evacuated and I could see the smoke from downtown. But when I got home and saw the towers collapse on TV I started crying. Later that night I turned my tv off because I could smell burnt plastic like it was overheating. Turns out it was the smell of burnt electronics coming from downtown. The hardest part for me as a witness to this event was seeing the city covered in ""missing"" posters. the subways were covered in them they were everywhere, all these pictures of smiling people presumed dead."

Now that I'm older and understand better- my gut wrenches to watch this. Being in the military now, I wonder everyday what the enemy is planning because of this and because of the things I hear regularly. You just never know and sometimes there is no warning, no matter how vigilant you are. I pray the families and victims found peace down the road."

That day I remember clearly, when my dad got me we heard on the radio of the south tower collapse, and when we got home i looked on the news and saw the second tower come down. I thought it was a dream it wasn't real i figured it was a realistic movie or something, of course after a few hours it set in. I'll never forget it"

When she came back in, she was visibly shaken and we kept asking her what happened but she ignored us and turned the tv onto the news. I couldn't fully comprehend what was happening, but I knew people were dying and when we found out it was intentional, I remember thinking we were being invaded or something. I legitimately thought people were going to invade the country and kill all of us. It was a scary time and it's hard to believe that all of the kids in school now only experience it through history books and documentaries. I can't believe it's already been seventeen years."

According to Paul Begley YouTube around Sept 11.2018 the fake Stream news media isn't reporting the following. Russia us threatening the US the news is coming out of Moscow with Direct Assault on our troops in Syria. As it prepare to assist Pres Assad in he final push to defend the pro democracy Rebels in that country. This Pro Democracy Rebel is a loose label since they are noted to be murders, looters and thugs. Pro Assad Syrian troops supported by Iran and Russian forces have begun their assault on the last rebel Eid-lib, stronghold. This Eid-lib has about 3 million people but as the battle unfolds, Russia, Syria, Jordan region. It is in the corner of Syria, it is a small region. Russia knows there a dozen of marines there located in well established fort, fortified buildings that help locals to help freedom fighters against Assad. Bashier al assad and Pres Putin accuses US of protecting terrorist in sharing facilities less than 20 km from the Jordan zone. It is 55 km exclusive zone at that base. For years we held that territory. Putin planning to assault this area. This area is consider a neutral zone. Russia has sent the largest military arsenal since the fall of Soviet Union. Syrian describes this Russian forces Mercenaries Operating for Wagner Security Co. open to cross the Euphrates River. This is escalating read Rev 16 in the Bible. Russia is saying we crossing the Euphrates River to kill ISS. The US is saying we have that covered. This is due to the Arab Springs .since 2011 Obama destablized the Middle East by knocking out leaders like Ben Ali, Josny kabhi of Japan, Moammar Quddafi of Libya, Allyalibi la la la la of yeman.

@kjlynch5453,"A lot of times, people can't remember when they started doing things that most people consider inconsequential or habit. I don't mean the first time you drove a car or the first time you tried alcohol. I'm talking about the first time you were able to write your name or the first time you walked your dog - things that you've been doing forever, that you know that you had to start doing at some point, but you don't remember when you started. For me, this was the very first time that I watched the news - and by watched, I mean that this was the first time I ever paid attention to the news. I remember coming home from first grade (I was six), and my oldest brother (he was eleven) was staring at the TV. My dad was in the other room (I realize now that he was trying to contact family who lived in New York). I was really curious as to what my brother was watching, and when I finally got to where I could see the TV, that was when I saw what was going on. Obviously, I didn't even know what a terrorist was at that point. My brother had asked my dad later that night why somebody would do that, so he understood that it wasn't an accident. While I was completely oblivious to the reasons behind the attacks, I still remember that it was the first time I ever felt ... it's kind of hard to describe: it's like the shock and horror that I feel now as an adult, just minus the knowledge of the motivations behind the attack."

CNN has this video uploaded 3 years ago. Why all of a sudden 8 years later they re-upload an event that has long passed. I have seen the footage of these events that show clear editing. There is footage where as the plane is flying the wing-tip happens to disappear behind a building when in fact the plan is portrayed as being in front of that building and flying past. How does that make sense? What brings me to this video and writing, is the fact that I searched all over for CNN coverage. I was having a hard time finding any footage by CNN on 9/11. Curious, I went to the CNN Youtube channel to discover the matrix of their so-called 59,058 uploaded videos that are displayed 6 wide and 176 deep. Displaying only 1056 videos before it stops allowing you to ""Load More"". So where are the other 58,000 videos that CNN supposedly has uploaded? I bet you they do not even have 499,364 ""real"" Subscribers. There is some funky stuff going on. Go try and find me footage uploaded 10 years ago by them. You cant find it. Why? Most likely because they realized there were bugs in their uploaded footage that exposed them as being apart of the exploited media. So, whats the best trick then to have Google (Already a company partnered with the government) keep upload amounts, and remove footage so that it looks like nothing has changed as the remove footage and re-upload new content 10 years later after the fact. I smell a bunch of people covering their asses."

My point is, if T37 crashed into a wooden building, it probably went 'through' the structure and stayed there, without actually crushing into pieces, the impact eventually reaching the gas tank. Let me ask you something, why was T37 flying that low? If you worked with the Navy Air wings, wouldn't you know there is a certain altitude limits that all military aircraft must follow ?"
@swordofisis,@sangyuni96 really? even on a smaller scale with a small wooden structure? I guess I never actually worked on F18s in the Navy either..maybe that was just a delusion too!

@sangyuni96,"No, I don't watch Michael Bay films. T37 is a light trainer, it is VERY small, I've seen it up close personally myself. You're comparing that to a Boeing 757, flying full speed full of fuel jet which is HIGHLY FLAMMABLE. It only takes common sense and a brain."
@swordofisis,@sangyuni96 I think youve seen too many movies in which cars and planes explode when someone shoots a gastank or crashes...
@swordofisis,@sangyuni96 and did you know that small trainer goes a fuck lot faster than a oversea passenger liner flying at max speed...which is only 350mph? it even has ordinance on it in the form of CADS which are used to jettison ordinance (even dummy ordinance) and external fuel tanks in case of emergency.
@swordofisis,@sangyuni96 Go to walmart and buy a butane torch and try to melt a piece of steel with it! BECAUSE YOU CANT! No matter how much you use! you have to get MAP gas or oxy acetylene! How come jet fuel from that small sized trainer didnt set a wooden building on fire? It was FILLED and LOADED with JP5!
@swordofisis,@sangyuni96 Why would you have to emphasize FILLED AND LOADED? is there a difference between the two? And if you didnt already know that jetfuel is basically kerosene that only combusts under high pressure. On top of that fact the airline industry invested millions and millions to make jetfuel NOT EXPLODE in a crash because the #1 cause of death in a plane crash was being burned by jetfuel! And think of how much fuel tanks and planes use and buy from corporations owned by politicians!
@swordofisis,"@sangyuni96 What if you were the president and your family and friends were weapons dealers, oilmen, and construction and security contractors and you started wars to make yourselves rich at the expense of taxpayer dollars? Would you really give two shits if you had your own private army and the resources of a nation to watch your back? If I were getting rich off exploiting the country i'd be cool with it too; but Im not so fuck them!"
@sangyuni96,"have you had any troubles eating, sleeping or going anywhere as you please? No. This isn't China or North Korea, do not take granted of opportunities you are provided with and stop whining."
@EmergencyGear911,@sangyuni96 But the biggest is the Patriot Act! Your freedom can be taken away whenever the Government wants now!
@EmergencyGear911,"@sangyuni96 1 - Control of the world's strategic oil reserves (PNAC) 2 - High return on investment for military products (Carlyle group, Movie ""Why we fight"") 3 - A global military presence, able to reach anywhere quickly (PNAC) 4 - Control over mass media/propaganda (OUTFOXED) 5 - Ability to manipulate the public's perception to gain support (Edward Bernaise, Century of Self) 6 - Progress toward one world government (New World Order) 8 - Financial/economic slavery (Zeitgeist Addendum)"
@sangyuni96,"you're comparing a small sized trainer aircraft with an oversea passenger liner FILLED and LOADED with jetfuel flying at max speed....yea...there is a difference.. If you're going to bring up 9.11 controversy bullshit, I will ask you one thing. What did US gain from 9.11? Besides spending millions of dollars on wars that are not going anywhere"
@swordofisis,A fucking T-37 slammed into an apartment complex building behind my old high school 15 years ago and it didnt even catch fire to the place....it didnt knock it down...and it is still there today because they just fixed it...and it is a wood frame structure!
@gettinmonee,How did building 7 fall again?
